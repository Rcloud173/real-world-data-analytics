# 🌐 GlobePulse Analytics: Real-Time Insights on Global Development

## 📘 Project Vision
This project builds a **live, automated data pipeline** that continuously tracks and visualizes key **global development indicators** across economic, health, digital, and social dimensions.  

Instead of relying on static CSV files or manual downloads, it uses a **Python-powered API pipeline** integrated with **Power BI** so that the dashboard **updates automatically** as new data becomes available.

> Goal: Move from *static reporting* to a **living global development monitor**.

---

## 🌍 What the Data Tracks
The pipeline aggregates indicators from **public global development APIs** (e.g., World Bank, UN, etc. — configurable via the Python script).

| Category | Example Indicators |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Economics** | GDP (current US$), GDP per capita, Trade Balance, Poverty Headcount Ratio |
| **Health** | Life Expectancy, Government Health Expenditure (% of GDP), Immunization Coverage |
| **Digital & Social** | Internet Penetration (% of population), Employment / Unemployment Rate |
| **Environment** | Forest Area (% of land area), CO₂ Emissions |
| **Regional / Global Aggregates** | Region-wise averages and rankings across all major indicators |

> Exact indicators are configurable in the Python extraction script via an indicator list.

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

### 1. Macro Overview (Global Baseline)
- Establish **global baselines** for GDP, health spending, trade, and digital access.
- Show **global summary cards** (KPI tiles) for key indicators.

### 2. Regional Comparison
- Compare **regions and income groups** on:
  - Health investment (Health spending as % of GDP)
  - Internet penetration
  - Poverty reduction indicators
- Identify **regions that over- or under-perform** relative to their income group.

### 3. Trend Analysis
- Track how critical indicators change over time:
  - Internet usage
  - Unemployment rate
  - Forest area (% land)
- Use **time-series visuals** to detect structural shifts, shocks, or improvements.

### 4. Correlation & Impact Analysis
Investigate **relationships instead of just plots**:

- **Digital Impact**
  - Does higher **internet penetration** correlate with:
    - Lower unemployment?
    - Better immunization coverage?

- **Financial & Health Impact**
  - Does increased **government health spending** correlate with:
    - Higher life expectancy?
    - Lower mortality indicators (if included)?

- **Performance Ranking**
  - Rank countries:
    - **Top 10** and **Bottom 10** in **poverty reduction** progress.
    - Best and worst in **health investment vs. outcomes**.

## 🧠 Insight Extraction & Documentation
For every major dashboard component:

- Clearly identify:
  - **What pattern is visible?**
  - **Where does it deviate? (Outliers / anomalies)**
  - **Which regions/countries are consistently leading or lagging?**
- Document insights with:
  - **Short, evidence-based interpretations**
  - **Avoiding naive causation claims** (only correlation, unless supported)
- Translate visuals into:
  - **Policy-relevant narratives** for:
    - Governments
    - NGOs
    - Development agencies
    - Researchers

All insights are documented in:
- `/reports/` as Markdown summaries or exported Power BI report notes.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

| Component | Technology |
|------------|-------------|
| **Data Extraction** | Python (`requests`, `json`) |
| **Data Processing** | Python (`pandas`, `numpy`) |
| **Visualization & Dashboard** | Power BI (Python script as data source) |
| **Scheduling / Refresh** | Power BI refresh or scheduled Python script (local / server) |
| **Documentation** | Markdown (`README.md`, analysis notes), Power BI bookmarks/tooltips |

## 🧱 Pipeline Architecture

**High-Level Workflow:**

```text
🌐 Public API(s)
       ↓
🐍 Python Script (extract.py)
  - Fetch JSON data
  - Normalize + clean
  - Merge across indicators/years
  - Output processed table
       ↓
📊 Power BI
  - Connects to Python script
  - Loads processed dataframe
  - Builds visuals + measures
       ↓
🔁 Auto-Refresh
  - Refresh triggers re-run Python
  - Dashboard always uses latest API data


---

## ⚖️ Ethical & Practical Considerations

- Uses **only public, aggregated, non-personal data**
- No **individual-level** or **sensitive personal information**
- Fully complies with the **terms of use, usage limits, and licensing** of each API provider
- The project's purpose is strictly focused on:
  - **Educational research**
  - **Analytical exploration**
  - **Policy-relevant insights**
- This project **is NOT intended for**:
  - Financial trading or investment decisions
  - Country shaming, bias-based analysis, or political targeting

> **Goal:** Support global development awareness responsibly, without misuse or misinterpretation.

## 🚀 Future Directions

### 🔮 Predictive Modeling Extensions
Integrate forecasting models (time-series & ML) to predict:
- **GDP growth trends**
- **Life expectancy improvements**
- **Internet penetration growth**

Potential models:
- **ARIMA / SARIMA**
- **Facebook Prophet**
- **Gradient Boosting / XGBoost Regressors**

### 📊 Extended Indicator Scope
Expand indicator coverage to include:
- **Education accessibility**
- **Gender equality indices**
- **Healthcare burden metrics**

### 🌐 Deployment Expansion
- Build an **interactive web dashboard** using:
  - `Streamlit` or `Plotly Dash`
- Sync real-time backend pipeline with:
  - Power BI
  - Web App Dashboard

### 🧮 Scenario Simulator
Create a **policy impact simulator**, e.g.:

> *How does a +1% increase in health spending affect life expectancy based on historical patterns?*

This will translate past data into **future actionable insights**.
